      <p class="c40 c9 title" id="h.kvtkk8ascpxb"><span class="c39 c37">Schitzo&rsquo;s Notes</span></p>
      <p class="c9 c30 subtitle" id="h.c8bdhft9vxmb"><span class="c37 c46">For edgerunners, combat notes, cyberware and
          Smasher class phycos. </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">Before we get started, I want to tell you schizophrenia sucks. And it&rsquo;s
          not
          just seeing or hearing things, it can be a pervasive paranoia about the world, yourself, or god knows what
          else.
          Who the fuck knows who causes it, but it melts your brain into delusion and madness. </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">It can happen with the onset of cyberpsychosis commonly, you will hear people or
          things talk to you, usually but not consistently your cyberware, giving you commands in accordance with their
          use.
          Sometimes you get a spider rig, and then suddenly work until your body is digested in the soup of your work,
          or,
          well, we&rsquo;ve all seen &ldquo;blood baths&rdquo;.</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok maybe you haven&rsquo;t, and
          maybe
          as a lawman I&rsquo;ve seen too much, these are all fair. But the point I&rsquo;m trying to make is
          schizophrenia,
          my curse, is far more serious than my name or my stories imply. However, to get help with cyberpsychosis, you
          will
          probably have to deal with it&rsquo;s label, and if you&rsquo;re unlucky like I am, it&rsquo;s
          nickname.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That isn&rsquo;t to say don&rsquo;t
          get
          help. For example, I&rsquo;m currently in extensive cyberpsychosis therapy for the second time in my life, and
          due
          to my long service as a lawman, and being seen as both senile and a minor threat to corpos. My precinct is
          paying
          for me to retire, as long as I get my cyber swapped for medical grade. Oh and never call them again.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">Anyways, I&rsquo;ve had a revelation. Unlike my usual schizophrenic episodes, I
          feel
          like I&rsquo;ve waken up from a dream. I&rsquo;ve begun forming a system for describing how the world works,
          based
          on stats, and skills. Will have a document that explains ppl later. But first, advice for edgerunners and the
          gods
          of this land.</span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">But you want some advice don&rsquo;t you?</span></p>
      <p class="c2 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well you don&rsquo;t get called
          unkillable for nothing. I&rsquo;ve been a lawman ever since I got booted from militech, and here are the most
          effective strategies edgerunners, boostergangers, and corporate folks (if you were wondering why no admin
          likes
          me) have used to kill me. For the record, none have succeeded, though many have won. </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span>I have the title unkillable not for surviving, but for being </span><span
          class="c18">grossly
          mangled</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and surviving. </span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <h2 class="c3" id="h.6upclj5prr3e"><span class="c26">Tactics</span></h2>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">Good Tactics are a skill you must learn, namely, before you end up in combat.
          But
          during can always work. In short, talk to experienced solos, find out what works for them. But here&rsquo;s
          what I
          know:</span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <h4 class="c28 c9" id="h.cmhphds8x8ze"><span class="c16">Team composition</span></h4>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">On overlap: A little bit of overlap is good, from what I&rsquo;ve seen, you can
          even
          make two med-techs work. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, every team has it&rsquo;s
          specialty, that&rsquo;s often good to keep the team&rsquo;s cohesion. Because you can end up in a team of
          mostly
          net-runners. While that can make you bad at combat, you know for a fact that you&rsquo;re going to steal
          digitally, and you&#39;re always going to go through the net. That kind of cohesion can help that
          group.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">And, even if it&rsquo;s just netrunners, that can even help them keep cohesion
          in
          combat. Given a signal to retreat doesn&rsquo;t need to be given. And also makes them a royal pain to
          prosecute.
          So be warned, if an experienced lawman sees you, the entire fucking department will see you as a severe
          annoyance.</span></p>
      <p class="c2 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">Leaders however: More than two fixers, or execs doesn&rsquo;t always necessarily
          end
          well. These kinds of folks don&rsquo;t really like each other, and can&rsquo;t really be bargained with.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">Rockerboys: Leaders of your most fun gigs. They can sometimes lead together, but
          will
          often butt heads. &nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span>But not all the people in their bands are rockerboys. Rockerboys, classically, are only the
          face of the band. They aren&rsquo;t necessarily the best players. For example, one of my favorite musicians,
          Rhymfest, is a good rockerboy, despite how much his material is loved, or his ability to produce and make
          music is
          legendary. He always ends up a tech to Kanye.</span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">Medtech requirement: You will need a med tech that you trust. However, they
          don&rsquo;t
          need to fight with you. You will only need someone who is good with first aid.</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, as a lawman, I go to
          the
          city hospital, and know everyone well. Also, because a lot of my compatriots either die or get promoted beyond
          me,
          I have skill in first aid and some paramedic techniques. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that can be inconvenient. When
          I
          made the switch from corpo to lawman, I was between medtechs for weeks, and in all likelihood, shouldn&rsquo;t
          have survived. So, if you can get a medtech, do.</span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">Solo requirement: Solos can fight better than anyone. however, when it comes to
          combat,
          a solid plan, avoiding combat and a medtech can replace them, For an experienced team. For an inexperienced
          team,
          get a solo.</span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <h4 class="c28 c9" id="h.hd3ovixvzi7j"><span>Other things you should do before combat</span></h4>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">Paranoia: Congratulations this is how schizophrenia can manifest. But seriously
          it&rsquo;s very helpful.</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No fixer cares about you. Not even
          Woodchipper. No exec will ever care more about people than money. Or they&rsquo;d be a rockerboy, Solo,
          or&hellip;
          you know what you get the point. </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span>keep an eye over your shoulder, I know solos are best at it, but rockerboys, execs, and
          medias
          should keep an ear to the ground if anyone wants them dead. And, let&rsquo;s be real here, fixers, you know a
          guy
          who can find out who&rsquo;s coming after you, don&rsquo;t short the cash </span><span class="c18">for
          once</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
      <p class="c2 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">Gear: Get the best gear you can. Steal for it, kill for it, nothing will have you
          live
          quite like gear. Oh, and to buy it, debt is good. As long as you have a plan to clear it within the month.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back when I worked for militech, if
          I
          intended to do low end pr work (also known as lynchings) for militech, I would mostly stick to food that
          month.
          But, if I was finally healed after the last stupid mission. It was a cyberarm (mine are all medical now), a
          popup
          grenade launcher, and the tyger claws would know the color of sky in their streets. </span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <h4 class="c28 c9" id="h.tnr7w52ldad0"><span>What probably got you in this situation and how to avoid it.</span>
      </h4>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">Debt: Debt can also be very bad. You do not want to have debt in-between jobs, and
          if
          you think it might happen, line up another job.</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, monetary debt is not the only
          kind
          that you don&rsquo;t want to have. If you are indebted to a person. They are probably far more willing to kill
          you.</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you ever wonder why your
          life
          sucks, ask yourself, who feels like you owe them? Namely if they feel like you&rsquo;ve fucked them. If
          it&rsquo;s
          your bosses, that&rsquo;s probably why you have more kills than most cybersquad folks, and are still a street
          cop.
        </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly, this is very simple, and
          there&rsquo;s next to no way to dodge it, you just have to be nice and pay in full. </span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">Fixers or execs: Everyone needs one. But don&rsquo;t expect them to fight by your
          side.
        </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">They say, the best allegory for the monsters in elfland&#39;s online is
          cyberphycos.
          And that may be true. But villains? These are them. Nothing can fuck you over quite like a fixer. And no one
          has
          the resources to ruin your life like an exec. </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">These people will know you&rsquo;re going to get shot way before you do. So, be
          the
          person they hire to shoot, or, tell them you&rsquo;re going to shoot someone to make their job easier. </span>
      </p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">You&rsquo;d be surprised how much credit you can get with a fixer who knows
          you&rsquo;ll tell them if you&rsquo;ll kill someone.</span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">Cults and boostergangs: If they aren&rsquo;t fighting now expect it.</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also includes religions, but,
          the
          difference between a cult and a religion is your propensity to die while worshiping. Religions fight other
          religions for mental space. And cults fight violently for mental space.</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangs are simmilar, but fight for
          territory, or sometimes market space if they&rsquo;re drug dealers. For the record, the drug dealers are as
          black
          hearted as corpos. Never trust them. Despite always being more fun.</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">Now, occasionally you can expect them to fight for you, if you do something for
          them. But take it from a lawman, who has seen this deal go south more times than I can count. Don&rsquo;t do
          that
          in the first place.</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avoid them, </span><span
          class="c18">always</span><span class="c1">. Do not spit on market preachers; they will know a cyberpsycho
          named
          Jesus who will tear you a new eye socket. There&rsquo;s three in my precinct.</span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">Lawmen: You got in trouble with the law? Well it happens to everyone. Seriously, I
          saw
          it, and had to start letting petty thieves go.</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But yeah so you broke the law,
          everyone
          does, even lawmen. The corpos do it the most with corruption and what not, but, we can always be bought or
          convinced otherwise. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seriously. Lawmen, such as myself,
          are
          cowards, and would rather either A, make money, or B, attempt to make the world better by talking things out.
        </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well the low ranking cops want
          that.
          C-squad will just kill you, and you won&rsquo;t be able to talk to our execs, but stay a low-priority problem
          and
          we&rsquo;ll walk.</span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <h4 class="c28 c9" id="h.vutymenx0opk"><span class="c16">So you didn&rsquo;t listen to me</span></h4>
      <p class="c5"><span>Don&rsquo;t worry, it happens all the time. Hell, I don&rsquo;t sometimes. What can I say, I
          see
          lone &nbsp;corpos, it&rsquo;s very hard for me to not shoot them. So here&rsquo;s basically how tactics
          work</span><span

            title=""></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">Cover: Also known as Ranged combat. Because if you aren&rsquo;t using cover in
          ranged
          combat you&rsquo;re doomed. So, thing about cover, you have to put all of your effort into popping out and in
          to
          shoot without being shot. </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">If you forget to move back into cover after you shoot, you will be shot. If you
          are
          not fast enough to move back into cover, you will be shot. Thanks to the nature of cover and intelligent edge
          runners, you will be shot period.</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">To deal with cover, buy and use grenades, rockets, heavy weapons. </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">However, if you want to deal with people behind cover, it is very simple, flank.
          Sure, you will probably get shot if you aren&rsquo;t stealthy, but, eh, ces&rsquo;t la vie.</span></p>
      <p class="c2 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">Armor: So, armor, like I said during gear, get the expensive stuff, and, if
          you&rsquo;re already a little crazy, just get a medium armorjack, the subdermal armor isn&rsquo;t worth it.
        </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I&rsquo;ve fought edgerunners
          with
          good armor, and nothing will make others retreat quite like amazing armor. Now I know this, having watched
          compatriots run the moment they realize autofire is the only way I&rsquo;m able to damage someone. So it can
          be
          extremely helpful.</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But be warned. Rockerboys, and
          crazier
          edgerunners will prefer hand cannons and explosives. And while whatever your fighting won&rsquo;t always
          penetrate
          whatever you&rsquo;re wearing, kinetic force will, and that&rsquo;s how you (and I did) break a rib.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">Fire: Nothing quite like it. Remember, molotov cocktails are finicky, and will not
          work, incendiary shells and flamethrowers work better.</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to dealing with fire,
          however, stay away from fire-spewers. And you&rsquo;ll probably be fine. Also of note, nades vs fire is
          entirely
          dependent on distance. So whoever wins is whoever moves faster.</span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">Melee: The best reason to get a linear frame. So, there&rsquo;s tons of ways to
          fight
          in melee, you could get a big pipe, hopefully a drive shaft like I have. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, this stuff breaks armor
          better than anything. And can crush bones easily. </span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">NADES!: The bane of all skilled edgreuners. What can I say, nades fix everything.
          The
          only thing that really stops them is melee and if you can put down your attacker before they get to you,
          you&rsquo;ve got no problems.</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though, fair warning, and a tip
          I&rsquo;ve exploited a number of times. Edgerunners who use nades get cocky. Very, very quickly. So if you,
          say,
          pack nades too, ambush, and out damage them. You can kill them with alarming eaze. </span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">Ambushes: Your best friend and your worst nightmare. This is fairly simple, be
          paranoid
          to avoid ambushes, and be ruthless to achieve ambushes. </span></p>

      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">Keeping your priorities straight: This is especially important for Solos, you can

          straight. If I&rsquo;m not in combat, I&rsquo;m entirely paranoid.</span></p>

      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">So, back a long time ago, before the red, and I ran around night city. I was a
          low
          ranking back alley brawler known as Mini Micah, because I was short. Your boy and his family were living in
          the
          northside district at the time of the bomb. When it went off, I, who was normally considered the third oldest
          and
          the second oldest boy, was now the oldest man and breadwinner, so, I took a job at Miltech, told my family to
          go
          to BosWash, and became Micro Micah, for reasons I wouldn&rsquo;t like to discuss.</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">Quickly, I was denoted as a good combatant, as I managed to survive being a low
          ranking ganger with only a shitty cyber lung as penance. It was later described as below medical grade, but I

          never found the time to get it replaced.</span></p>

          idea,
          at dv 18, it&rsquo;s the old brainmelter, it&rsquo;s a terrible idea, but maelstrom will want it. At dv 21
          They
          know it causes fuck up your body, but, the ability to go about double the speed of a normal Sandy.</span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">There are two teams, replace either with the party, or make them a third
          party.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">The Shoes have two boats, first, the rammer a jetski, with a road ganger with drive
          sea
          vehicle 10, and that&rsquo;s about it. And second a cheap speedboat, with one reclaimer chief, with drive sea
          vehicle 10, the rest on the boat are party minus one booster gangers. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">They will never back down.</span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">Militech has four boats, three are jetskis two are staffed with one security
          operative,
          one is staffed a road ganger with drive sea vehicle 10 sea. </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">Finally, the shipping craft. Better defended by a security officer, and a
          bodyguard,
          and a road ganger with drive sea vehicle 10.</span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">The two teams plans are such: The Shoes will ram one jetski, and as that skirmish
          develops, send the speedboat to swarm the main ship.</span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">Militech&rsquo;s plan is to fight that, and use the jetskis to find out where
          attackers
          are before they hit. Militech officers will jettison cargo of rations once one of their jetskis has been
          cleared,
          and the speedware once all jetskis have been cleared. </span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">And if this goes through the Shoes will swarm upon the rations, avoiding the rest
          of
          the fight. </span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">The shoes and Militech will require 2000 eb per person. </span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">9 human perception to find out the bodyguard has this plan if they&rsquo;re

      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">If you were wondering, I jettisoned the rations because I know the shoes, and
          they
          want food more than the speedware. </span></p>
      <p class="c2 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">For the record, I&rsquo;ve seen the old &ldquo;faster speedware&rdquo; thing go

          many times. Every scientist thinks they&rsquo;re awesome developing faster speedware, but honestly it&rsquo;s
          about as fast as the brain can handle. So this mission can happen at any time. </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Faster speedware&rdquo; often works like this. And the one on the boat,

          once

          militech

      <p class="c5"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see, in the early time of the red, there
          wasn&rsquo;t much to do. So, it was customary to throw cyber psychos in a big maze and see who came out. Oh

      <p class="c5 c8"><span>Shit mines are every-day, it&rsquo;s literally just 20eb worth of explosives. Cheap mines
          are
          premium, and real mines are expensive. Trip Fires are premium and powertrips are Expensive, all of this
          requires a
          18dv basic tech to setup, without fear of going off, that is, if they&rsquo;re not used.</span><sup><a

      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">The party just needs to use an action to see all traps within the area. In fact,
          they may even notice a few [insert party member&rsquo;s sexual persuasion here] in the audience.</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">All traps have 1 hp. And an 18dv basic tech to repurpose, and only activate when
          stepping on their square.</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">The bets on the party are 1 to 20 BTW.</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">It starts at 2000eb per party member if one guy goes in, but 1000 eb per if
          everyone
          goes in and breaks usual rules. </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">Any fixer in the city could have told the party this was a bad idea. Even
          fucking
          Kirk. </span></p>
      <p class="c2 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c2 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">How did I beat him? Well, back when I was a streetrat of a solo, I took a
          sandivison
          and never looked back. So, once an hour (the fight was 6 hours long) I lit it up, shot the beast and hid
          behind
          some shit. </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">I knew the speedware he had was secretly killing him, and this if he ever hit me
          I
          was as good as dead. So after six fights, that were more of just two shots fired per, the beast&rsquo;s brain
          fried, I was low-key hated, but some advertisers used that to show how much better militech was.</span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there&rsquo;s no rest for the
          wicked. I would say &ldquo;Or for Solos&rdquo; But lets be real here guys we&rsquo;re not great. So I took
          another
          job in the psycho dome.</span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there was this one chick. Twig,
          twig
          was probably gonna die. However, she was not listed as a beast, only took non-beast contracts, so you needed
          to be
          careful you didn&rsquo;t kill her. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, every solo would rather lose
          than
          kill twig. Because, apparently twig was hot, and her boyfriend had a cybersnake. And I mean, she had a clean
          face,
          but her titties&hellip;Whatever. Either way, this was a problem. Supposedly taking away the thrill of the
          sport
          when she came on. That no one would kill her.</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So another advertisement guy comes
          up
          to me, says &ldquo;Hey Micro Micah, you&rsquo;re careful right?&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes.(no)&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ok, well if you could beat
          twig
          without killing her it would be great for the precision of militech. OH and I&rsquo;d be really pissed if you
          fucked this up.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So immediately my plan was stupid.

          the
          solos would have to be extremely careful, and she&rsquo;d probably win. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she does this, and this solo,
          Dawg,

          dawg,

      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alpha, is probably a cyberphyco,

          2.</span>

          But
          the ads would not have you believe that. Oh no, I was shone shooting her with the Militech derringer, a pea
          shooter. But, despite my stupid stories, what was actually shone, was that militech lies, but gets results.

      <p class="c5 c8"><span>So clearly the next best thing for me to do was become a fake cop. A militech cop if you

      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I had any advice to solos, it
          would
          be thus, they mean competition. And same for protection racquets. Not much else. Money is not secured with
          them
          usually, and they, do actually have the skills to back up their weapons, so don&rsquo;t seek them out to kill
          them. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if you want something they
          are
          guarding, it is common courtesy to kill them all. No survivors. See, Militech men will run after getting a
          shot
          off on you. So, don&rsquo;t let them do so. </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">That isn&rsquo;t to shit on any stealth based solos, it&rsquo;s a valid
          strategy. It
          is also thought that if the guards never notice you in the first place, Militech will kill all the guards, so
          that&rsquo;s ok too.</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">You may ask why am I so willing to kill them? Well, I live in a warzone with

          Also, I ran out of cyberware I wanted, and wanted to pace myself, so here I am. </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">The solo&rsquo;s digest will tell you you should kill all Militech supreme

          But I&rsquo;m going to give some advice. </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span>Every supreme squad has a badass. And I don&rsquo;t mean a regular solo. No I mean like a
          regular solo with more cyber than they can handle. Speaking of, my job keeps trying to give me primetime, and
          i
          don&rsquo;t know about you, but once you have an implanted grenade launcher you become </span><span
          class="c18">very</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;weary of anything like that. Also, who would you rather fight?

        <li class="c5 c10 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Militech supreme is the newest, hottest rent-a-cop knockoff. You
            may
            as &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s more expensive how is it a knockoff?&rdquo; Well, because unlike rent-a-cop, it will
            make you a massive target once they leave. </span></li>
        <li class="c5 c10 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">There is also a gang known as the Bozos. Who are demons. With
            clown

      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bozos have boostergangers equal to the
          edgerunners, Militech has just two bodyguards with high quality shotties. </span></p>
      <p class="c2 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">This really is more of a solo vs. Solo fight. And of note, Schitzo is one

          either
          succeeds on a dv 18 resist torture and drugs check, or have level dampening cyberaudio suite, or immidatly

          the damaged ear critical injury.</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes 9 seconds (three turns)
          for
          it&rsquo;s compressor to be able to fire it again, and while it&rsquo;s doing that, it&rsquo;s so goddamn loud
          the
          user must make the injury check. Basic tech dv 18 to find that out. </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">Can be underclocked so that it doesn&rsquo;t make so much noise, then, will take
          three seconds to fire up again.</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lack of hearing can be added to

      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c4"><span>&gt;Continuing the story&lt;</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, It was up to me to fight this
          bastard off. My co-workers handled the boosters fine enough, but, it was up to me to fight this demon. </span>
      </p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the horn first sounded I
          grabbed
          my ears, and accidentally tore them off. So I fought like a rabid dog. But by the time I finally realized what
          was
          going on. The bozos were laughing at my buddy. So, I hopped cover and began to beat the shit out of the
          boosters.
          I killed them all, but horn man hit me, broke my leg, and I fell. He put a gun up to my head, and I got up,
          limping, and he began laughing at that. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That &ldquo;you big man- so
          destroyed
          by a simple gun? HAHAHGAH&rdquo; </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then beat him to death. And that
          felt
          good, really good. So, I went to go get a reflex co-processor. I wanted to be able to dodge some shit, and get
          a
          bit heaver armor.</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what happened next? The last
          success
          of the shoes, that&rsquo;s what&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

          cyberpsycho
          and killed his corpo masters and is on the loose. </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">He hasn&rsquo;t been blazing a trail of blood, so he&rsquo;s a bit harder to
          find.
          And may not-technically be considered a cyberpsycho, but his bounty defanity says otherwise. </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m still in a full on warzone. So, well I don&rsquo;t know cyberphycos
          are
          fucking insane. He could go anywhere. Other news. The bozos have been getting more and more ruthless. Turning
          into
          more of just a threat, rather than a mystery. Their bounties have been reflecting that. </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">It is thought that Micah, also known as the former &ldquo;Bitch steve&rdquo;
          from
          phycodomes. Was scarred by a bozo attack, as a militech supreme operation. Which may spell the doom of most of
          that for days to come. </span></p>

          toward
          the bozo&rsquo;s hideout, he&rsquo;s like 20 miles out, what the shoes (who have a lot of experience with
          cyberphycos) think will happen is he will tire out and start killing randomly</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">They&rsquo;ll throw on an extra grand per player if he&rsquo;s taken in

      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He should be found easily by the
          sound,
          and he will go with the edgerunners when asked, and sneak (or try to) sneak away whenever possible</span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">Y&rsquo;all should probably sedate him, </span></p>
      <p class="c2 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">If he&rsquo;s caught he&rsquo;ll attemp to trick edgerunners to go to the bozos.
          If
          that fails, he will attemp to break any restraints and kill the bozos.</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span>So, if you managed to get your hands on some </span><span>danger</span><span
          class="c1">&nbsp;girl documents I stole, as a god you probably have access to their roster. In the front
          there&rsquo;s Tomfool, in the building are the dead ringers, and in the basement Blamo. Big top is almost
          never at
          the actual building. But what Schitzo wants is for them to pay, and every single bozo dead. It&rsquo;s up to
          you
          what&rsquo;s in there, as he&rsquo;ll probably die to Tomfool.</span></p>
      <p class="c2 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span>However, it&rsquo;s 20 fucking miles </span><span class="c18">of night city</span><span
          class="c1">&nbsp;away. It&rsquo;s not that hard to stop him from getting to the bozos. Someone (on the way)
          will
          have cyberphyco cuffs, or sedatives and he&rsquo;s not exactly going to be killing randos &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
          what
          Bozos do! I&rsquo;m a cop dammit!&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c2 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">If however, you actually manage to level their base, He will find some sedatives
          and
          jack himself because &ldquo;what? I&rsquo;m going cyberpsycho, this is procedure.&rdquo; He cannot understand
          that, maybe, this was a cyberpsychosis induced decision. </span></p>
      <p class="c2 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c2 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c2 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c2 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">From this point on words the shoes and I skipped town and left night city
          &ldquo;*GASP* Not in a body bag?&rdquo; Oh no, we left through body bags, got thrown out, and regrouped in a
          landfill. </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">We found some nomads (who told us about the bags), and they took us to the scar.
          We
          took a deal with BIO.OS and became the start of the SCPD. Or the local police force of the city. </span></p>
      <p class="c2 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">But that&rsquo;s for the story of the edgerunners of the Scar, which is
          everything
          else. </span></p>
      <p class="c2 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">working for Vios and then meet someone suffering from the same disease as schizo
          who
          believes that BIO.OS is controlling everything. This will be the Starting fixer, they will die.</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">If they just choose to one innovation 20 Merc eventually comes he&rsquo;s
          completely
          broken is there to destroy them some fixers will know what to do with him.</span></p>

      <p class="c2 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <h1 class="c9 c33" id="h.reaj0nz9hmnp"><span class="c36">The one great story from the scar:</span></h1>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">A few years back, there was this medtech, a smasher class, and some stupid ass
          nomad, who&rsquo;s some legend, who were the biggest danger BIO.OS ever experienced. They usually had an extra
          guy, there was a rockerboy, a piranha, and some netrunner, who ran with them. </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">No one knows quite what happened to them. Well, I don&rsquo;t, I hallucinate
          their
          stories too much to be sure. </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">But I figure that someone wants to tell stories about this, so a piece of
          advice.
          Most good stories alternate between straight conflicts, like &ldquo;Can I lie to this mf and get away with
          it?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Will I not die here?&rdquo; and changing circumstances around those conflicts.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">Doesn&rsquo;t make sense? Well it&rsquo;s all cliffhangers and developments, as
          some
          say. But those are just cool words, I mean what I said earlier. </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">But there&rsquo;s a bit different notes for the beginning and ending of stories.
          Stories start with some reason as to why you&rsquo;re going to (die) go into conflict. And ends on a cool
          attempt
          to change that, and a note on how, and if it&rsquo;s changed.</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">You may say &ldquo;Wow Micah, (Or steve let&rsquo;s be real) you sure know a lot
          about how to tell a story, where&rsquo;d you learn that?&rdquo; And honestly? It&rsquo;s because I tell my
          nieces
          and nephews a story every tuesday, and thursday, usually of these characters, and they (though they may not
          know
          it) are the best at keeping track of what happened. So, I&rsquo;m going to walk you though the basics of
          this.</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">Step one: figure out what story beats and moments they&rsquo;ve attached to,
          saying
          &ldquo;Ok, who remembers what from the last story?&rdquo; And they&rsquo;d ramble on about stuff, I&rsquo;d
          make a
          note in my notes of what they remember, and we&rsquo;d begin with a hook.</span></p>
      <p class="c2 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">Step two: Hook. Something needs to happen to grab their attention. I find
          it&rsquo;s
          easy to just latch onto whatever conflict I had in mind during the resolution of the last story. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you don&rsquo;t have that,
          and
          are starting, I have a foolproof method. There&rsquo;s two step ones you could do. </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">Option A, go for something simple and temporary (for edgerunners) like
          forgetting to
          pay the rent, or having an empty bank account and needing food. Option B is an opening hook of ambition, the
          main
          character really wants something, and fucks over allies, and usually themselves to do it. </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">Then introducing a bigger threat, more repeatable threat over the story, like
          you
          stole from, any fixer, for your goal, and now their entire system is after you. Or, you &nbsp;broke into your
          own
          home and your local slumlord wants to make an example of you. And either he does, or the long chain of
          slumlord
          and gang leaders who he works for gets mad at you when he fails. </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span>Finally, you can also introduce the nuclear option, having something slowly killing you.
          Like
          cyberware from a corpo taking over your mind. A super serum slowly killing you. You </span><span
          class="c18">can
        </span><span class="c1">start with that, but mot stories really start with some small problem, like your hair
          being
          stupid, and developing into something insane like there&rsquo;s now a mind control shampoo out there. </span>
      </p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span>In short, in this world of greys, it&rsquo;s somehow always your own fault. </span>

      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">Of note, when going for fun, subordinates can be drunk, but the person who leads
          needs to be sober enough to make decisions. I have been filled with a lot of lead by forgetting this.</span>

      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">These are actually important notes for the game master to remember, not notes

      <p class="c5 c8"><span>But here&rsquo;s what you need to know before modding a story. This </span><span
          class="c18">should</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;happen in your story, as you may find, people naturally come
          up
          with the most interesting thing to happen. It&rsquo;s why dreams are always cool.</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">The Scar, is one hundred stories tall, 100 streets long, one hundred avenues
          deep.
          There are levels above one hundred built ontop by corpos, levels below one that aren&rsquo;t just the low
          road.
        </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">On the levels:</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">The Road, level 0, or the rumbling, is a road carved not by BIO.OS, but directly
          under the Rock, lies an extremely fast, pitch black tunnel that any nomad with no intention of staying in the
          city
          go through. Of note, there&rsquo;s Nomad watering holes on both ends of the Scar. Yes, bug detectors still
          beep.
          Security, and the right to not be investigated is not something that happens in the scar.</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span>Low levels, level 1-25, are the most population dense areas in the scar. And have
        </span><span class="c12 c18">by far</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the nicest people in the scar. Generally, this
          is where
          everyone goes when first arriving at the scar. Generally, you will have to pay protection fees to the SCPD and
          the
          piranhas, but rent is about the same as Night city with that. </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">Mid levels, level 26-74 generally, all of these levels are either BIO.OS&rsquo;s
          and
          used to export goods, or used by large factories and employers as production space. I think there&rsquo;s a
          steel
          foundery and an amusement park around here. There&rsquo;s also some of the best shops, though not the best
          bars,
          they&rsquo;re all on lower levels. </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">Above level 30, there&rsquo;s tolls on the roads, and you have to pay to move
          above
          every level above 50. </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">High levels, levels 75-110, or corpo levels, are generally, stupid. They have
          office
          space, exceptional apartments, and only pay protection money to the SCPD. At levels above 80, you have to pay
          for
          every step on each stone, and above 100, for every step. I have no idea why, and I&rsquo;ve never been.
        </span>

      <p class="c2 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span>Now, on the nature of BIO.OS </span><span class="c13 c37">AND THIS IS MASSIVE SPOILERS FOR
          ANYONE
          READING THIS OUTSIDE OF THE SCAR, YOU TELL A GOOD STORY ABOUT THE SCAR, BY SLOWLY QUEING YOUR AUDIENCE IN ON

          IT RUNS, NOT BY OUTRIGHT TELLING THEM HOW IT WORKS.</span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c13 c37"></span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">Now that that&rsquo;s over, a note. Everything that happens in the scar is

      <p class="c2 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">There are many, many oil extraction points below the road.</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">BIO.OS isn&rsquo;t actually in the scar to farm. It chose the scar, because of
          it
          being impossible for hostile entities to be able to tell how it&rsquo;s farms are doing from aerial
          photograph.
          And because under the scar, is one of the biggest and young oil reserves on the planet. After (Spoiler) an
          Arasaka
          mass driver dropped a rock on Indianapolis immediately liquefying any and all carbon biomass in the area. (Or
          whichever city the gods liked the most. Here it&rsquo;s indianapolis because there is no reason that place
          should
          have existed otherwise) </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">All BIO.OS oil extraction is, preformed by either enslaved AIs, possibly
          divergent
          copies of BIO.OS or already automated. It&rsquo;s such a deep secret in fact, I only began writing that I knew
          about it, and remembered, until I found Jack off ice and running a boring dojo. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H2WOAH, and SOVOIL eventually find

          weapons
          than the NUSA and EU combined, as it does actually control the Canadian uranium mine, and froze every single

            they
            pay with BIO.OS&rsquo;s money and claim it&rsquo;s theirs</span></li>
        <li class="c5 c10 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">The groups, of their own volition, make allies (who are already

      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually how (and why) the
          war
          between Pirhannas and SCPD happened. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shoes, as you may remember from
          the
          Ballad, were a down on their luck gang, and moved to the Scar, and as they had the title of SCPD, they started
          a
          protection racquet, known as taxes. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We came into the city, were paid
          tax
          dollars and tried to keep the city safe, we allied ourselves with some groups, and they begged us to arrest
          their
          criminals, we did, and they were nicer when we came around. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, a &ldquo;commisener&rdquo; came to
          be,
          supposedly a soulkilled person in a robot, but, they were immdetily elected the head of the SCPD, helped nil
          with
          out problems, and our chief of police, Milwaukee, (formerly size 3) actually helped us cops </span><span>with
          ou</span><span class="c1">r problems, caused some, and didn&rsquo;t just give us orders. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The piranhas also began a
          protection
          racquet, and gained quite a bit of territory against us. They were given MAC3 as a reward, and they got a
          special
          &ldquo;Informant&rdquo;.</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, both the Pirhanas and
          SCPD&rsquo;s territory fractured, taken up by many groups, and BIO.OS guided us to take it all back. So much
          so,
          that we&rsquo;re the only two protection racquets in the city. </span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tell you this all, to note that
          every
          single business in the Scar has a story like this. And while yes, we were able to take prostitution as a crime
          off
          the books, this war never will end, and I&rsquo;m sorry to every poor kid stuck in it, both sides, especially
          to
          the families I left without their loved ones. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you wanna know something
          hysterical? BIO.OS is the best option any of us are going to get. Europe won&rsquo;t let us in, Night city is
          more
          dangerous, and the NUSA is carved out by every single president&rsquo;s ambitions constantly. Everywhere else
          is
          owned by a worse corp. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is another, very easy
          option.
          The Cult of the Rumbling. Either a segment of Netwatch, or the eventual end to the sunset collective, who
          wanted
          to end rogue AIs. They are a cult, also requiring full control over their members, with churches full of
          recruiters, facilities covered in full dark filled with prisoners and workers. And they&rsquo;re the only
          other
          group with access to the oil under the scar.</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their head, Marthis, the one winged angel, is
          a
        </span><span class="c18">legendary</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;netrunner, who was able to find out how much
          BIO.OS
          skimped out on checking it&rsquo;s own facilities for intruders, and is only able to check for bugs by
          abnormal
          movement. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, every moment Marthis understands more and
          more
          about how BIO.OS works, how to steal it&rsquo;s oil, and how to disguise itself, making </span><span
          class="c18">by far</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the most efficient and dangerous threat to BIO.OS. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They eventually sell the
          information
          about the oil to H2WOAH, a water plant draining Lake Michigan, for a few engineers to make oil pumps that can
          be
          deconstructed to dodge BIO.OS. H2WOAH sells that info to SOVOIL, and their tech is combined to fuck up
          BIO.OS.</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H2WOAH, by the way, has a wall of people stuck
          doing captcha like problems, which together, is actually more powerful that BIO.OS, but it&rsquo;s prone to
          invisible bugs. But if they successfully teamed up with the cult, and BIO.OS never figured out that hiring
          edgerunners means not even </span><span class="c18">it</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;can predict what&rsquo;s
          going
          to happen, making Marthis&rsquo;s control a mute point. They would have won the fight in a month. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But BIO.OS did, it hired these
          edgerunners, in hopes that making it impossible to predict, would be enough to out play the human corpos.

      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This story has a fairly simple
          start, a
          few edgerunners in night city had the bills due, and no gigs, so they followed a shity net ad, metup in a shit
          bar, picked up what little they had, and with a nomad ended up in the Scar. </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span>They see why the scar is called that, the massive, hundred story tall boulder the city is
          built
          into is carved beautifully, by the fractal-esc Arasaka macrobots. (For the record they work </span><span
          class="c18">exactly</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;like microbots, spreading out over a large area, and
          preforming a
          simple directive, and have a consistent, beautiful pattern to cover a mass, and then each having small
          thrusters
          that drive the thing much bigger than them off of the ground. But they&rsquo;re each like, two feet long and
          one
          foot wide.) However, the superhighway cuts through it, like a scar. And as they enter, they see all the signs
          for
          &ldquo;The rumbling&rdquo; offering free beds and food, as the party says goodbye to the horizon for the next,
          well, week probably. </span></p>
      <h3 class="c15 c9 c8" id="h.i3fj5j74ph0v"><span class="c20">Cliffhanger </span></h3>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have managed to get lost in the
          scar&rsquo;s local &ldquo;amusement park&rdquo; Often just called &ldquo;The park&rdquo; </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1st trap, due to (intentionally) poor signage,
          you
          all somehow end up on a race track like the &ldquo;Autobahn&rdquo; in germany. However, the exit is through
          the
          track. There&rsquo;s no other exit. It&rsquo;s 10 eb to go though, and the clerc in full flak, </span><span
          class="c18">Will</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;threaten the edgerunners with the overlord handcannon.
          They&rsquo;re
          just a boosterganger, but that offers a +1 to intimidation. Also of note, it&rsquo;s a DV12 weapons tech to
          realize that that gun is shit. Yes you can add solo points to that. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clerc backs down if you notice that.
          However,
          if you just shoot him like many reasonable people have, they throw a hardened outrider on a roadbike with
          enhanced
          interface plugs, bulletproof glass, and NOS. He wants to arrest the party, (with EMP cuffs, brought from home)
          and
          take them in </span><span class="c18">alive</span><span class="c1">. Move to SCPD Hook. </span></p>
      <h3 class="c15 c9" id="h.inlbe1240wms"><span class="c20">Development</span></h3>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you&rsquo;ve finally made it to
          the
          actual mission. You have been sent into &ldquo;The fire&rdquo; Where there&rsquo;s two fixers, Mac1, and old
          Gorge, old Gorge, being himself, will invite the party to his table and offer a meal. Next to him, is new
          gorge,
          seeing everything the net has to offer, but, given he&rsquo;s navigating it with virtuality, he&rsquo;s
          probably
          fairly deep. He&rsquo;s also short and small enough to do this in the booth they sit at. Being like twelve in
          the
          scar occasionally has advantages. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon realizing that they&rsquo;re
          here
          for the truck, he sends them to Mac1, a man in a full flak suit. Who is very shady, and never stands, but he
          sends
          you to the mission. Robbing a water truck from the cult. </span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <h3 class="c15 c9" id="h.7w51fp62npbd"><span class="c20">Climax</span></h3>
      <p class="c5"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, The path down to the truck is like any
          usual
          walk to slums, except vertical, down stairs or circular ramps, but you can still see the boring, cheap
          restaurants
          turn into more dangerous restaurants and slum housing, until, eventually you get down to the bottom layer of
          the
          scar. And that place is </span><span class="c18">pitch, black.</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The party probably didn&rsquo;t
          realize
          that they were saying goodbye to light walking past the perpetual fire hazard that is all slums, but they
          either
          need flashlights, or something better.</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of, a perception check of
          DV18, or possessing low light eye, there&rsquo;s other people, watching you just past where flashlights
          reach.</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual water truck,</span><sup><a
            href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;is fairly boring, samey plastic tanker,
          samey
          aluminum cab. It&rsquo;s a european style truck if that still means anything. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truck has two ways in,
          there&rsquo;s a net linkup, which any netrunner notices, and a regular startup. Pick lock DV15 or land vehicle
          tech DV 18 to jumpstart it, or there&rsquo;s the net architecture. </span></p>

      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They use cuffs to take the

      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The west entrance is covered by six
          cult boys, and they have outrider in a shitty van to transport Dog. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the notice that the party is
          fucking
          something up, the deal is destroyed by disagreement, and if something actually spooks them, like a gunshot in
          the
          hallway, the groups will fire on eachother. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good luck!</span></p>
      <p class="c2 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <h3 class="c15 c9 c8" id="h.53wrzoz1ck2e"><span class="c20">Resolution</span></h3>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the party just waits, the cult
          leaves with Dog, and SOV.OIL leaves with the money. I&rsquo;m going to be honest, if you get to this point,
          just
          get the evidence and leave. </span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So here&rsquo;s what actually happened.
          Hesus&rsquo;s were actually fairly well trained for something like this, but they had nowhere near enough gear
          or
          money to be that good. But their priest, Jesus (said with an H, no idea why) realized that they could send
          their
          guy Slim in, have him leave plastic bags full of Chooh</span><span class="c34">2</span><span
          class="c1">&nbsp;to
          force the teams to run and leave the building, and then the rest of the crew would wait at either end and gun
          down
          whoever ran away.</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That plan didn&rsquo;t actually
          work.
          Slim got all the way past every single SOV.OIL guy, and then was heard by the cult, and sent the order to
          detonate
          the bombs. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immidetly SOV.OIL and the cult shot
          at
          eachother, Dog broke out, climbed up into the vents, met slim, both of them backed away from eachother like
          dogs.
          Slim lappeled off a rope down the north side of the building, and Dog jumped off the south side and just
          tanked
          that shit. (He&rsquo;s somewhere in the fields after this) </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end, the Hesus&rsquo;s only
          had
          to fight the east and west entrance guard, as the innards of the building were starved of oxygen and were
          crushed
          when the building fell in on itself. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crew radio&rsquo;d the SCPD, said that all
          threats were on site and evidence, ran away and setup a church with the 10,000 eddies. The SCPD considered
          this
          &ldquo;good enough to be pardoned of trespassing&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c2 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>

          get
          that info, and even then, you&rsquo;ll probably piss off some mid level corpo that didn&rsquo;t even do
          anything

      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could also buy it from them,
          which
          is much easier, and Brain did. But this is a free guide, so I&rsquo;m not telling. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing about quick hacks,
          despite
          them being terrifying, is that you need to have something hooked up to the net, or ziggurat, like an agent.
          But in
          short, they either &ldquo;ZAP&rdquo; you from an internal agent, or set your agent on fire, mild fire but
          still.

      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facing out of the door, is a
          flamethrower, then a flamethrower facing that flamethrower, all the way down a 12 meter long hallway
          (there&rsquo;s 5 flamethrowers in total)</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it turns. There&rsquo;s then a
          30
          meter long hallway, and at the end of it, two assut rifle turrets. 10 and 20 meters down the hall are 2

      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">Finnaly, there&rsquo;s a net hookup near the power-in of the vault. </span></p>

          he is wearing metalgear, and has an education of 20. Saddam takes 13 damage to his head piece, which is eaten

      <h3 class="c15 c9" id="h.da5t5d59tn8b"><span class="c20">ARTILLERY COMBAT</span></h3>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, very few edgerunners who only
          stick
          to night city have ever fought one of these things. As quite frankly, Artillery batteries are only useful in
          point
          defense, and if you build something this powerful in night city, someone will always blow it up. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus, the lifecycle of an
          artillery
          battery:</span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the need of an artillery
          battery
          is established. Many bases have anti aircraft artillery as generally, nukes can be bad. But other places can
          have
          them installed for land/sea vehicle combat if they&rsquo;re expecting nomad raids, or anti personnel if they
          expect protests. And a gun is purchased for 50,000 eb,(super luxury)</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">Second, the battery is installed only on a specialty of land built for
          it&rsquo;s
          use, on a building, generally, it caves in the ceiling. There&rsquo;s a 1 out of ten chance the first time
          this
          thing is fired, the gun found a new aquifer. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a man needs to train to use
          the
          gun. It&rsquo;s a type of science, INT is its base stat. And it&#39;s firing men are fairly easy to kill. If
          you
          get there, and that&rsquo;s a big if. Oddly enough, they tend to be very similar to boostergangers, with like
          a 13
          in artillery.</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next it&rsquo;s used regularly, because of the
          stupid edgerunner wisdom &ldquo;if it&rsquo;s well defended, it&rsquo;s worth it&rdquo; where edgerunners will
          rush and steal anything that&rsquo;s hard to get, </span><span class="c18">just because it&rsquo;s hard to
          get</span><span class="c1">. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artillery firing isn&rsquo;t like
          regular combat, Artillery is always last in combat order, and every artillery attacks at the same time. the
          man on
          the machine picks their target. If it&rsquo;s the target their machine is meant for (aircraft, land/sea
          vehicles,
          personnel), if it choses a target it&rsquo;s not meant for, it takes a minus 4 to hit. Then it makes an attack
          with the sniper rifle range table. Then, if it hits, the target takes 24d6 damage. Or, if the gods are lazy,
          loses
          the entire section the gun was pointing at.</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, within a month, a stealth
          team
          goes in, puts a lock melter in it, and the place gets hit with a 500kg bomb, or gets anything worth a damn at
          its
          location &nbsp;stolen.</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus is the life cycle of an

      <h3 class="c15 c9 c8" id="h.9lvs06kkkvxc"><span class="c20">Junta tech. </span></h3>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok so a long time ago, in a land
          formerly known as &ldquo;Indianapolis&rdquo; Someone realized how close the germans were to making biological
          chips that could control tech. A now forgotten group called &ldquo;The Junta&rdquo;, who formed alongside
          early
          netrunner &ldquo;let&rsquo;s end the gang of four&rdquo; sentiment, immediately kidnapped who they could from
          Germany. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Average Junta brainwashing was that
          all
          of the competing political groups in that organization, like Anarchists, Socialists, early klepto capitalists,
          could co exist peacefully, (under their rules) and because they could, they were the one revolutionary group
          to
          rule them all. And, with all the kidnapping bribery, and other ways they managed to get scientists to their
          cause,
          they actually completed development of &ldquo;Gen 3&rdquo; Cybernetics, two years before Germany, in the
          massive
          and spralling underground complex of the now coined &ldquo;Polis&rdquo; </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devices they developed
          aren&rsquo;t
          actually able to acquire power the normal way, but need to be charged at night. And for that matter, they were
          developed separate from the &ldquo;corporate generalist&rdquo; or &ldquo;This is a good deal to buy&rdquo;
          idea of
          cyberware, but built more for the &ldquo;We are a starving paramilitary group, we will do whatever it takes to
          win.&rdquo; Many of the insane, cursed cyberware here, and never in catalogs were developed here. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, they also developed the first
          standardized super soldier, with various strategies to decrease humanity loss, most of which were lost to
          time.
          But getting each of these setup&rsquo;s is fairly easy to acquire. And every single rig has been made to
          include
          cyber you keep after service.</span></p>

      <h3 class="c15 c9" id="h.3r0l4lgjggbp"><span class="c20">EMPs to the brain</span></h3>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;d like to start with a
          short
          explanation of what an EMP does. An EMP is a pulse of energy (some kind, my intelligence is still 2), that
          causes
          a surge in wiring. Normally, medtech&#39;s main defense is wiring cyberware to dump the charge, temporarily
          breaking being standard.</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neuralware, however, is a bastard.
          If
          neural ware, being the smallest cyberware, dumps it&rsquo;s charge, it will be to your brain, and you will be
          knocked unconscious. </span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s the explanation I was
          given, all I know that happens is that most of your other cyberware shuts off first, but if you have
          neuralware,
          and it gets to the actual link to the brain, you pass out. </span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, a really smart tech had beef
          with
          maelstrom, and thus, one of the easiest ways to find out if you&rsquo;re in a midnight market were
          created:</span>
